# Person Manager Webpage

Hello!  
My name is Kristiina, and this is my completed Person Manager webpage assignment.  
While I initially had limited experience with Spring Boot Java, and Docker, 
I worked hard to learn and apply these technologies. 
I hope my project meets your expectations and 
thank you for taking the time to review my assignment.
